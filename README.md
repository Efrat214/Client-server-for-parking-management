# Client-server-for-parking-management in Java

The Client-server-for-parking-management project is a software solution for efficient parking space management. It implements the "client-server" mechanism to provide real-time information on parking space availability and enable users to easily manage and control parking spaces.

## Features

- Client-server architecture: The software follows a client-server model where parking space information is stored on the server and accessed by clients.
- Parking space allocation: Users can enter the name of their vehicle and a parking number to check for available parking spaces. They receive the allocated parking number if a free space is available or a notification if all spaces are occupied.
- Visualization of occupied spaces: The software includes a visual representation of occupied parking spaces. This feature allows users to see the real-time status of parking spaces, distinguishing between occupied and available spaces.
- Efficient management and control: The project aims to provide an advanced solution for parking management, enabling efficient control and management of parking spaces.
- User-friendly experience: The software offers a convenient and efficient user interface, allowing users to easily access parking space information and perform operations.
